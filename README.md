# DE-nanodegree

Repo containing the project's code of Udacity's Data Engineering Nanodegree.

## Projects

1. [Data Modeling with PostgreSQL](1-data_modelling/Postgres): Create a database and ETL pipeline in Postgres for a
   music streaming app. Apply the Star schema, define the Fact and Dimension tables and insert data into the tables.
2. [Data Modeling with Cassandra](1-data_modelling/cassandra): Create a NoSQL database and ETL pipeline with Apache
   Cassandra for a music streaming app to answer analytics questions.
3. [Data Warehousing with AWS Redshift](2-data_warehouses/Redshift): Create a cloud data warehouse in AWS Redshift and
   an ETL pipeline for a music streaming app. Apply the Star schema, define the Fact and Dimension tables and insert
   data into the staging and production tables.
4. [Data Lakes with Spark](3-spark_datalakes): Create a cloud data lake in AWS S3 and an ETL pipeline with Spark for a
   music streaming app. Apply the Star schema, define the Fact and Dimension tables and partitioned data into the data
   lake.
5. [Data pipelines with Airflow](4-airflow_pipelines): Create a robust data pipeline with Apache Airflow loading data
   from an S3 data lake to a Redshift warehouse in a star schema.
6. [Capstone data engineering project](5-capstone) End-to-end ETL pipeline with Apache Airflow, Apache Spark and AWS
   Redshift.
